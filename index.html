                                Welcome to the home page of my Portfolio CA. This CA should begin to show how I have experienced and adapted through my college career in the world of computing.
                                My name is Rhys Grainger, i hwas given the x number x00162031 in first year on day one with my student card. The course I gained entry to was Computing in first year.
                                I had a little experience in computing and coding but I had vast interest in coding, programing, computational desgin and web design going into first year. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After first year we could specify into different streams, the stream or decipline that I choose was software development.
                                Over the course of many hours and hours of work and practice I have now made it into fourth year where i have numerous different resutlts 
                                and grades to choose from for this project
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            of my responsibility.
                            A key role of my job there was maintaining firewall and active directory access for companies that we maintained the security for.
                            If the security was comprised we had to make sure that the breaches were contained and that no files such as the accountancy books were harmed at all.

                          sent on site to help fix issues. For example one time I was sent on site for 8 hours fixing server rooms and setting up active directory accounts out there 
                          for the company as there site had been temparily gone offline. It was valuable experience in which i learned a great deal.

                      <p class="text">The first project that i did was in second year. I had to do it with three other of my class mates in order to make sure we fulfilled the required metrics.
                        what we had to do was build an online shopping application where we had steps to follow through but also had to make up functionality of our own.
                        <span class="more-text">
                            The extra functionality that we had to show was of our own creation. We made a wishlist in which consumers could add an item to the wishlist by hitting a liked button
                            another was a review feature on the end of every product that we had in the shop. we used the card function from boostrap to show both positive and negative comments
                            The more functionality that was required was a stripe payment, checkout, a thank you page, product and category pages and a login page to make sure everything was working
                            correctly.

                        mentioned above. This project has to be thought up, written, created and presented by myself without anyone elses input. This makes it quite the daunting task.
                        <span class="more-text2">
                            What I plan to do in this project is create a real time chat application using the python framework Django. I wanted to style and base my project similar to whatsapp and facebook
                            messenger as they are universally used all over the world. I would be using parts of boostrap in the front end and django-websockets to allow me to conenct the front end to the back end.
                            I am hoping to implment a feature to be able to send emojis and other images to allow  me to have a better functionality.

                    <p>One of my main achievements that i have done in my time in college is win the Division 1 All Ireland Rugby League
                      This was the second time in consecutive years that I have done it with TUD. This year we beat Althone IT by a point to win the league final
                      Having not being able to play rugby for the college for the first two years thanks to covid it was nice to be able to bring home some silverware.
                      In the following semester we have the the cup final. I am hoping that we can do the double for the first time in the college's history.
                      Being from Wales originally, rugby was always a big thing for me and i am proud to represent the college.
