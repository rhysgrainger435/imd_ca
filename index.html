                                Welcome to the home page of my Portfolio CA. This CA should begin to show how I have experienced and adapted through my college career in the world of computing.
                                My name is Rhys Grainger, i hwas given the x number x00162031 in first year on day one with my student card. The course I gained entry to was Computing in first year.
                                I had a little experience in computing and coding but I had vast interest in coding, programing, computational desgin and web design going into first year. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After first year we could specify into different streams, the stream or decipline that I choose was software development.
                                Over the course of many hours and hours of work and practice I have now made it into fourth year where i have numerous different resutlts 
                                and grades to choose from for this project
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            A key role of my job there was maintaining firewall and active directory access for companies that we maintained the security for.
                            If the security was comprised we had to make sure that the breaches were contained and that no files such as the accountancy books were harmed at all.
